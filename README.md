# Graphlog

Website for prolog graph analysis.

## Overview
Academic project for AI course.

The project objective is building a prolog Knowledge Base capable of analyzing graphs, and than answer to the following queries:

- [ ] Is the graph Eleurian?
- [ ] Is the graph Hamiltonian?
- [ ] Is the graph a tree?
- [ ] Which node is the tree root? 
- [ ] Which nodes are the tree leaves?
- [ ] What are graph's paths?
- [ ] What are graph's walks?
- [ ] What are graph's cicles?
- [ ] Is the graph a tree?
- [ ] Is the graph bipartite?
- [ ] Shortest path given 2 nodes?
- [ ] Longest path given 2 nodes?
- [ ] What is graph's chromatic number?
- [ ] What is the node with higher grade?
- [ ] Whats is a node's star?

The project second objective is building a website with a GUI that allows to:
 
- [ ] Build graphs
- [ ] Highlight nodes
- [ ] Answer previously described queries
