# Graphlog
Academic project for AI course.

The project objective is building a prolog Knowledge Base capable of analyzing graphs, and than answer to the following queries:

 - [ ] Is the graph Eleurian?
 - [ ] Is the graph Hamiltonian?
 - [ ] Is the graph a tree?
 - [ ] Which node is the tree root? 
 - [ ] Which nodes are the tree leaves?
 - [ ] What are graph's paths?
 - [ ] What are graph's walks?
 - [ ] What are graph's cicles?
 - [ ] Is the graph a tree?
 - [ ] Is the graph bipartite?
 - [ ] Shortest path given 2 nodes?
 - [ ] Longest path given 2 nodes?
 - [ ] What is graph's chromatic number?
 - [ ] What is the node with higher grade?
 - [ ] Whats is a node's star?

The project second objective is building a website with a GUI that allows to:
 
 - [ ] Build graphs
 - [ ] Highlight nodes
 - [ ] Answer previously described queries
